Contract: The contract signed by Web Industries to create this SQAP.

Defect: A defect is an imperfection in the software that introduces faults into the system. These faults could be a security vulnerability, resource inefficiency, stalling, miscommunication between components, even a system crash. Defects can also be made in planning the product. This can happen when the designs are ambiguous, or designs that don't meet the needs of the stakeholders.
